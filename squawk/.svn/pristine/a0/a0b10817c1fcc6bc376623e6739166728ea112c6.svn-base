/**
 * The <code>Throwable</code> class is the superclass of all errors
 * and exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are
 * instances of this class (or of one of its subclasses) are thrown
 * by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the Java
 * <code>throw</code> statement. Similarly, only this class or one of
 * its subclasses can be the argument type in a <code>catch</code>
 * clause.
 * <p>
 * Instances of two subclasses, {@link java.lang.Error} and
 * {@link java.lang.Exception}, are conventionally used to indicate
 * that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances
 * are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation so
 * as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).
 * <p>
 * By convention, class <code>Throwable</code> and its subclasses have
 * two constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
 * <code>String</code> argument that can be used to produce an error
 * message.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Throwable</code> class contains a snapshot of the
 * execution stack of its thread at the time it was created. It can
 * also contain a message string that gives more information about
 * the error.
 * <p>
 * Here is one example of catching an exception:
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 *     try {
 *         int a[] = new int[2];
 *         a[4];
 *     } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
 *         System.out.println("exception: " + e.getMessage());
 *         e.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * @version 1.43, 12/04/99 (CLDC 1.0, Spring 2000)
 * @since   JDK1.0
