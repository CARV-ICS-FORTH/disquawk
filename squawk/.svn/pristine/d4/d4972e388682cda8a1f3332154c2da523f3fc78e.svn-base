# Check to see if the build jars (from svn) match sources
# This detects a failure to check in the build jars after changing
# code in builder.

# Probably a better way, but this works too...
# 1) gets all of the java sources files in builder
# 2) does a stat on all of those src files, as well as the builder jars
# 3) Sorts the result by mod date
# 4) Looks at the two most recent files
# 5) They better not be java source files...
