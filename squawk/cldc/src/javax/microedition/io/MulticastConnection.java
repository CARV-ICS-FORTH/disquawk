/**
 * This interface defines the capabilities that a datagram connection must have.
 * <p>
 * Reminder: Since the CLDC Specification does not define any actual network
 * protocol implementations, the syntax for datagram addressing is not defined
 * in the CLDC Specification. Rather, syntax definition takes place at the level
 * of Java ME profiles such as MIDP.
 * <p>
 * In the sample implementation that is provided as part of the CLDC reference
 * implementation, the following addressing scheme is used:
 * <p>
 * The parameter string describing the target of a connection in the CLDC
 * reference implementation takes the following form:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  {protocol}://[{host}]:[{port}]
 * </pre>
 *
 * A datagram connection can be opened in a "client" mode or "server" mode. If
 * the "//{host}" part is missing then the connection is opened as a "server"
 * (by "server", we mean that a client application initiates communication).
 * When the "//{host}" part is specified, the connection is opened as a
 * "client".
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * A datagram connection for accepting datagrams<br>
 * datagram://:1234
 * <p>
 * A datagram connection for sending to a server:<br>
 * datagram://123.456.789.12:1234
 * <p>
 *
 * Note that the port number in "server mode" (unspecified host name) is that of
 * the receiving port. The port number in "client mode" (host name specified) is
 * that of the target port. The reply-to port in both cases is never
 * unspecified. In "server mode", the same port number is used for both
 * receiving and sending. In "client mode", the reply-to port is always
 * dynamically allocated.
 * <p>
 * Also note that the allocation of datagram objects is done in a more abstract
 * way than in Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE). Instead of providing a concrete
 * <code>DatagramPacket</code> class, an abstract <code>Datagram</code>
 * interface is provided. This is to allow a single platform to support several
 * different datagram interfaces simultaneously. Datagram objects must be
 * allocated by calling the <code>newDatagram</code> methods of the
 * <code>DatagramConnection</code> object. The resulting object is defined
 * using another interface type called
 * <code>javax.microedition.io.Datagram</code>.
