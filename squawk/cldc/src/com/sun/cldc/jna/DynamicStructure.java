/**
 * A DynamicStructure is a structure with support for getting the field offsets 
 * for a particular platform from native code.
 * 
 * A native data "layout" structure must be defined that contains the offsets. By convention,
 * the name of the data structure is CLASSNAME+"_layout", where CLASSNAME is
 * equal to class.getName().replace('.', '_').replace('$', '_');
 * 
 * The C layout structure is an array of 4-byte words. The first element is the length total of this layout structure itself in words.
 * The second element is the size of the structure being described in bytes.
 * The remaining elements are the offsets of the fields of interest to the java code. The order isn't important, but it's typically in
 * the order that the fields are defined in the C and java structures.
 * 
 * The Java format of the layout is an int array. It's like the C layout, but without first "layout length" field.
 * The first element of the Java is the size of the C structure in bytes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * IN C:
 * #define com_sun_squawk_platform_posix_callouts_Libc_Stat_layout_LEN 5
 * const int com_sun_squawk_platform_posix_callouts_Libc_Stat_layout[com_sun_squawk_platform_posix_callouts_Libc_Stat_layout_LEN] = {
 *         com_sun_squawk_platform_posix_callouts_Libc_Stat_layout_LEN, 
 *         sizeof(struct stat),
 *         offsetof(struct stat, st_mode),
 *         offsetof(struct stat, st_mtime),
 *         offsetof(struct stat, st_size)
 *     }
 * 
 * IN JAVA:
 * 
 * package com.sun.squawk.platform.posix.callouts;
 *
 * class LibC {
 * 
 *      static class Stat extends DynamicStructure {
 *          final static int ST_MODE_INDEX   = 1;
 *          final static int ST_MTIME_INDEX  = 2;
 *          final static int ST_SIZE_INDEX   = 3;
 *
 *          final static int[] layout = DynamicStructure.initLayout(Stat.class, 3);
 * 
 *          public int[] getLayout() {
 *              return layout;
 *          }
 * 
 *          public void read() {
 *               Pointer p = getPointer();
 *               st_mode  = p.getShort(layout[ST_MODE_INDEX]) & 65535;
 *               st_mtime = p.getInt(layout[ST_MTIME_INDEX]);
 *               st_size  = p.getLong(layout[ST_SIZE_INDEX]);
 *           }
 *       
 *          ....
 *      }
 *      ....
 * }
