 * The Tracer class encapsulates a set of static methods that are used to
 * emit execution traces to a print stream.<p>
 *
 * It is intended for usage of this class to be statically conditional. That is,
 * it need not exist in a production deployment. As such, all calls/references
 * to this class should be wrapped in a conditional test of the final static
 * boolean variable {@link Klass#TRACING_ENALBED}. For example:<p>
 *
 * <p><hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     if (Klass.TRACING_ENABLED) && Tracer.isTracing("loading", klass.getName()) {
 *         Tracer.traceln("Loading "+klass.getName());
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr><p>
 *
 * If the value of <code>Klass.TRACING_ENABLED</code> was statically
 * determined to be false by javac, then this whole block of code would be
 * omitted from the compiled class.
