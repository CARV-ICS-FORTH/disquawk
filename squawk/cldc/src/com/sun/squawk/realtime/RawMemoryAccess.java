/**
 * An instance of <code>RawMemoryAccess</code> models a range of physical
 * memory as a fixed sequence of bytes. A full complement of accessor
 * methods allow the contents of the physical area to be accessed through
 * offsets from the base, interpreted as byte, short, int, or long data
 * values or as arrays of these types.
 * <p>
 * The <code>RawMemoryAccess</code> class allows a real-time program to implement device
 * drivers, memory-mapped I/O, flash memory, battery-backed RAM, and similar
 * low-level software.
 * <p>
 * A raw memory area cannot contain references to Java objects.
 * Such a capability would be unsafe (since it could be used to defeat
 * Java's type checking) and error-prone (since it is sensitive to the
 * specific representational choices made by the Java compiler).
 * <p>
 * Many of the constructors and methods
 * in this class throw {@link OffsetOutOfBoundsException}. This
 * exception means that the value given in the offset parameter is either
 * negative or outside the memory area.
 * <p>
 * Many of the constructors and methods
 * in this class throw {@link SizeOutOfBoundsException}. This
 * exception means that the value given in the size parameter is either
 * negative, larger than an allowable range, or would cause an accessor
 * method to access an address outside of the memory area.
 * <p>
 *  Unlike other integral parameters in this chapter, negative values are
 *  valid for
 *  <code>byte, short, int,</code> and <code>long</code> values that are
 *  copied in and out of memory by the <code>set</code> and <code>get</code>
 *  methods of this class.
 *  <p>
 *  All offset values used in this class are measured in bytes.
 *  <p>
 *  Atomic loads and stores on raw memory are defined in terms of
 *  physical memory.  This memory may be accessible to threads outside the
 *  JVM and to non-programmed access (e.g., DMA), consequently atomic
 *  access must be supported by hardware.  This specification
 *  is written with the assumption that all suitable hardware platforms
 *  support atomic loads for aligned bytes, shorts, and ints.
 *  Atomic access beyond the specified minimum may be supported by the implementation.
 *  <p>
 *  Storing values into raw memory is more hardware-dependent than loading values.
 *  Many processor architectures do not support atomic stores of variables except for
 *  aligned stores of the processor's word size.  For instance, storing a byte into memory
 *  might require reading a 32-bit quantity into a processor register, updating the register to
 *  reflect the new byte value, then re-storing the whole 32-bit quantity.  Changes to other bytes
 *  in the 32-bit quantity that take place between the load and the store will be lost.
 * <p>
 *  Some processors have mechanisms that can be used to implement an atomic store of a byte, but
 *  those mechanisms are often slow and not universally supported.
 * <p>
 *  This class supports unaligned access to data, but it does
 *  not require the implementation to make such access atomic.  Accesses to
 *  data aligned on its natural boundary will be atomic if the processor
 *  implements atomic loads and stores of that data size.
 *  <p>
 *  Except where noted, accesses to raw memory are not atomic with respect to the memory
 *  or with respect to schedulable objects.  A raw memory area could be
 *    updated by another schedulable object, or
 *  even unmapped in the middle of a method.
 *  <p>
 *  The characteristics of raw-memory access are necessarily platform dependent.
 *  This specification provides a minimum requirement for the RTSJ platform, but it also
 *  supports optional system properties that identify a platform's level of support for atomic
 *  raw put and get.  The properties represent a four-dimensional sparse array with boolean values
 *  indicating
 *  whether that combination of access attributes is atomic.  The default value for array entries is
 *  false.
 *  The dimension are
 * <table width="95%" border="1">

 *   <td>0 to 7</td>
 *   <td><p>For each data type, the possible alignments range from </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>0 == aligned </li>
 *       <li>to data size - 1 == only the first byte of the data is <em>alignment</em>
 *         bytes away from natural alignment.</li>
 *     </ul></td>

 *         on that processor.</li>
 *       <li><em>smp</em> means that access is <em>processor</em> atomic, and atomic
 *         with respect across the processors in an SMP.</li>
 *       <li><em>memory</em> means that access is <em>smp</em> atomic, and atomic
 *         with respect to all access to the memory including DMA.</li>
 *     </ul></td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 *  The true values in the table are represented by properties of the following form.
 *  javax.realtime.atomicaccess_&lt;access>_&lt;type>_&lt;alignment>_atomicity=true
 *  for example:
 * <pre>
 *  javax.realtime.atomicaccess_read_byte_0_memory=true
 * </pre>
 *  Table entries with a value of false may be explicitly represented, but since false
 *  is the default value, such properties are redundant.
 * <p>
 *    All raw memory access is treated as volatile, and <em>serialized</em>.  The run-time must be forced to re-read
 * memory or write to memory on each call to a raw memory getxxx or putxxx method, and to complete the reads and writes in the order they
 * appear in the program order.
