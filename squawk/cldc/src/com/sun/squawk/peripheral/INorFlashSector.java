/**
 * Define a segment of memory which is defined as being of type NOR Flash.
 * The read-only mode of NOR memories is similar to reading from a common memory,
 * provided address and data bus is mapped correctly, so NOR flash memory is much
 * like any address-mapped memory. NOR flash memories can be used as execute-in-place
 * memory (XIP), meaning it behaves as a ROM memory mapped to a certain address.
 * A NOR flash sector can be completely erased, setting all bits to 1s.  Writing simply
 * sets some bits from 1 to 0.  Setting a bit from 0 to 1, requires the complete sector
 * to be erased.
