/**
 * The word type is used by the runtime system and collector to denote machine
 * word-sized quantities. It is used instead of 'int' or 'Object' for coding
 * clarity, machine-portability (it can map to 32 bit and 64 bit integral types)
 * and access to unsigned operations (Java does not have unsigned int types).
 * <p>
 * This class is known specially by the translator as a <code>SQUAWKPRIMITIVE</code>
 * and programming with it requires adhering to the restrictions implied by this
 * attribute. Some of these constraints are imposed to keep the job of the
 * translator simple. All of these constraints are currently enforced by the
 * translator. The constraints are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       A local variable slot allocated by javac for a Squawk primitive variable
 *       must never be used for a value of any other type (including a different
 *       Squawk primitive type). This is required as the translator cannot currently
 *       de-multiplex reference type slots into disjoint typed slots. This restriction
 *       on javac is achieved by declaring all Squawk primitive local variables at
 *       the outer most scope (as javac using lexical based scoping for register
 *       allocation liveness).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       A Squawk primitive value of type T cannot be assigned to or compared with
 *       values of any other type (including <code>null</code>) than T.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       A Squawk primitive value of type T cannot be passed as a parameter
 *       values of any other type than T. For example, you cannot
 *       call T.toString(), or String.valueOf(T). The methods of the classes NativeUnsafe and GC
 *       have a special permission to allow Squawk primitive values to passed in place of
 *       parameters of type Object.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Only the public methods of this class which do not override any of the
 * methods in java.lang.Object will be available in a {@link VM#isHosted() non-hosted}
 * environment. The translator replaces any calls to these methods to native
 * method calls.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism was largely inspired by the VM_Word class in the Jikes RVM.
