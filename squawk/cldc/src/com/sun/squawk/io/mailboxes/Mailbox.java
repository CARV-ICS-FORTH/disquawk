/**
 * <b>deprecated</b> <i>Use the higher-level {@link Channel} and {@link ServerChannel} classes instead.</i><p>
 *
 * The Mailbox class is likely to become a private imeplementation-only class.<p>
 *
 * A Mailbox is used to receive and read messages. Only the "owning" isolate has a reference to
 * a Mailbox. A Mailbox may be registered with the system by name, allowing clients to get a MailboxAddress that refers
 * to this Mailbox. A Mailbox can accept messages from any number of clients, and these messages are queued in the order received.<p>
 *
 * Messages from each client are tagged by the client's private MailboxAddress. A client may use multiple independent MailboxAddress
 * to the same Mailbox. This allows multiple logical connections to be managed by the same message queue.<p>
 *
 * The logical connections are created by the system when the client does a MailboxAdress.lookup(). The connections are
 * closed when the client closes the MailboxAddress, which causes a AddressClosedEnvelope message to be sent to the Mailbox,
 * or when the Mailbox is closed, which invalidates the MailboxAddresses that refer to it.<p>
 *
 * A Mailbox has to acknowledge a new logical connection by providing the MailboxAdress that a client should use for future
 * messages. A server must specify a MailboxHandler to handle opening new logical connections when it registers it's Mailbox by name.
 * A MailboxHandler may create a new MailBox and new Mailbox address, in order to support private Mailboxes for different clients (see {@link ServerChannel}).<p>
 *
 * The MailboxHandler is also responisble for handling MailboxAddress closed events. It may track the event, and cleanup other state, or it may indicate that
 * that an AddressClosedException should be thrown once all previous sent envelopes have been received.
