 * A ByteArrayInputStreamEnvelope can be used to pass a byte array, or subsection of a byte array, as a 
 * ByteArrayInputStream. This is a zero-copy way  (except for the envelope object itself) to send the 
 * contents of a byte array to another isolate.<p>
 *
 * The main drawback of using ByteArrayInputStreamEnvelopes instead of ByteArrayEnvelopes is that
 * if the sender makes any changes to the byte array encapsulated by the ByteArrayInputStreamEnvelope,
 * these changes may be visible to the receiver of the envelope. <p>
 *
 * This can avoided in applications that implement replies or awknowledgements for all sent envelopes by 
 * not re-using the original byte array until the receiver sends some reply or acknowledgment back.
