 * Given that a {@link Channel} is a one-to-one connection between two isolates, a ServerChannel 
 * provides a factory to create new Channels by name. It is similar to how network sockets
 * can use a port number to accept a number of client connections.<p>
 * 
 * A server can use the <code>accept</code> method to accept new client connections, which will return a new Channel
 * that the server can use to talk to the client. A server may choose to service each Channel in a separate thread.
