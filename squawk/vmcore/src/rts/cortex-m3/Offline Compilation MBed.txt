Setting up MBED offline compilation

I managed to get this working on my mac at home. It was running OSX 10.5. On 10.6, the installation of G++ Lite did not produce working executables (Likely because OSX 10.6 runs in 32 and 64 bit and G++ didnt like it). In Windows 32bit, compilation works fine. The downside of using Virtualized Windows, Is that you cannot mount the MBED. You must copy the .bin back to OSX and load it from there.

On Windows..

Download Eclipse.
Install the C++/CDT package.
Install CodeSourcery G++ Lite- EABI: http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/subscription?@template=lite
  (Make sure the  topmost bin folder is in your PATH)
Install the GNU/ARM toolchain for eclipse: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/files/gnuarmeclipse/0.5.3/org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu_0.5.3.201007311800.zip/download

For setting up the project, I used this guide: http://dev.frozeneskimo.com/notes/compiling_your_own_cmsis_code_for_the_mbed

Here is a quick summary of the guide.
Download CMSIS 1.3 from http://www.onarm.com/download/download395.asp
Extract the contents.
From here you will need to copy the following files:
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/CoreSupport/core_cm3.c
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/CoreSupport/core_cm3.h
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/DeviceSupport/NXP/LPC17xx/system_LPC17xx.c
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/DeviceSupport/NXP/LPC17xx/system_LPC17xx.h
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/DeviceSupport/NXP/LPC17xx/LPC17xx.h
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/Example/Sourcery G++Lite/LPC17xx/startup_LPC17xx.s
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/Example/Sourcery G++Lite/LPC17xx/LPC17xx.ld
CMSIS_V1P30/CM3/Example/Sourcery G++Lite/LPC17xx/main_LPC17xx.c
And the Makefile from http://dev.frozeneskimo.com/code/mbed-cmsis/Makefile 


Now you need to modify your Makefile.
Delete the “GROUP(-lgcc -lc -lcs3 -lcs3unhosted -lcs3micro)” line (line 21) from LPC17xx.ld linker script. I don't believe we have the luxury of linking to some of these libraries with the free CodeSourcery toolchain, but we don't need to either.
Change “ENTRY(_start)” to “ENTRY(main)” (line 19) in LPC17xx.ld.
Change “_start” to “main” on line 126 in startup_LPC17xx.s.
Adjust the sample LED flashing program in main_LPC17xx.c for the mbed pinout: I just changed the FIODIR 0xB0000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF and the LED being turned on from 1«28 to 1«18 (this corresponds to LED1 on the mbed board).

In Eclipse, Make a new C++ Project. 
I selected Makefile Project and the G++ Toolchain.
Copy past the above files into your project.
Edit the main to your needs. 

You should now be able to use make to build your project and create the .bin executable.
