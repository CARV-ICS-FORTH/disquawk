/**
 * A <code>MIDLet</code> is a MID Profile application.
 * The application must extend this class to allow the
 * application management software to control the MIDlet and to be
 * able to retrieve properties from the application descriptor
 * and notify and request state changes.
 * The methods of this class allow the application management
 * software to create,
 * start, pause, and destroy a MIDlet.
 * A <code>MIDlet</code> is a set of classes designed to be run and
 * controlled by the application management software via this interface.
 * The states allow the application management software to manage
 * the activities of multiple <CODE>MIDlets</CODE> within
 * a runtime environment.
 * It can select which <code>MIDlet</code>s are active at a given time
 * by starting and pausing them individually.
 * The application management software maintains the state of the
 * <code>MIDlet</code> and
 * invokes methods on the <code>MIDlet</code> to change states.
 * The <code>MIDlet</code>
 * implements these methods to update its internal activities and
 * resource usage as directed by the application management software.
 * The <code>MIDlet</code> can initiate some state changes itself
 * and notifies
 * the application management software of those state changes
 * by invoking the appropriate methods.<p>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> The methods on this interface signal state
 * changes. The state change is not considered complete until the state
 * change method has returned. It is intended that these methods return
 * quickly.<p>
