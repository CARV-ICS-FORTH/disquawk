/**
 * The GlobalVar annotation can be applied to method declarations in a 
 * Library to indicate that the body of the method should be a getter or setter 
 * or a C global variable of a similar name.<p>
 * 
 * When applied to a method with no parameters and a non-void return type, 
 * a getter method will be generated for the C variable with
 * the same name as the method.<p>
 * 
 * When applied to a method with a name starting with "set", and 
 * with one parameters and a void return type, a setter method will be
 * generated for the C variable with the name as the method (ignoring teh prefix "set").<p>
 * 
 * All other cases will result in an error at code generation time.<p>
 * 
 * Example: Accessors for  the C variable "errno"
 * 
 *    @GlobalVar
 *    public int errno();
 * 
 *    @GlobalVar
 *    public void seterrno(int value);
 * 
 * The GlobalVar annotation can be used with the {@link NativeName} annotation to specify
 * a sperate natve name for the global variable getter and/or setter.
